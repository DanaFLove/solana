# Conceptual Design

**Mixer Program Basics:**
Deploy a Solana program written in Rust that manages a pool of funds.

Users deposit SOL into the program, which tracks deposits without directly linking them to withdrawals.

Withdrawals are processed in a way that obscures the link between the sender and receiver.

**Anonymity Mechanism:**
Use a Merkle tree or similar structure to store commitments (hashed deposit amounts and user secrets) on-chain. This allows users to prove they deposited funds without revealing their identity.

Implement a withdrawal system where users provide a proof (e.g., a nullifier to prevent double-spending) that doesn’t expose the original deposit transaction.

**Key Features:**
Deposit: Users send SOL to the program with a secret value, creating a commitment.

Withdrawal: Users submit a proof to withdraw funds to a different address, breaking the on-chain link.

Obfuscation: Leverage off-chain coordination or time delays to mix transactions from multiple users.

# Technical Challenges
**Solana’s Transparency:**
Solana’s blockchain is public, and all transactions (even to a program) are visible. You’d need to ensure the program’s logic sufficiently obfuscates the link between deposits and withdrawals.

**Proof Systems:**
For stronger privacy, integrate a cryptographic proof system like zk-SNARKs. Libraries like bellman or arkworks can help, but they’re computationally heavy and may clash with Solana’s fast execution model.

**Account Management:**
Solana requires accounts to be pre-allocated and rent-exempt, so your program needs to handle account creation and funding efficiently.

**Scalability:**
Mixing requires multiple users to be effective. A single-user mixer is easily traceable.
