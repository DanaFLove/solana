Conceptual Design
Mixer Program Basics:
Deploy a Solana program written in Rust that manages a pool of funds.

Users deposit SOL into the program, which tracks deposits without directly linking them to withdrawals.

Withdrawals are processed in a way that obscures the link between the sender and receiver.

Anonymity Mechanism:
Use a Merkle tree or similar structure to store commitments (hashed deposit amounts and user secrets) on-chain. This allows users to prove they deposited funds without revealing their identity.

Implement a withdrawal system where users provide a proof (e.g., a nullifier to prevent double-spending) that doesnâ€™t expose the original deposit transaction.

Key Features:
Deposit: Users send SOL to the program with a secret value, creating a commitment.

Withdrawal: Users submit a proof to withdraw funds to a different address, breaking the on-chain link.

Obfuscation: Leverage off-chain coordination or time delays to mix transactions from multiple users.
